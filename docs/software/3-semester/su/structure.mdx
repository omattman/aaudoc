## Summary of structures

![Structure Activites](/images/structure-activities.png)

### Purpose

To describe structural relations between classes and objects in a problem
domain.

### Concepts

Class structures

- Generalization: A general class (the super class) describes properties
  common to a group of specialized classes (the subclasses).
- Cluster: A collection of related classes

Object structures

- Aggregation: A puperior object (the whole) consists of a number of
  objects (the parts).
- Association: A meaningful relation between a number of objects.

### Principles

- Study abstract, static relations between classes.
- Study concrete, dynamic relations between objects.
- Model only the necessary structual relations.

### Results

The result is a class diagram with classes and structures.

## Object-Oriented Structures

We apply two kinds of object structures: **aggregation structures**, which describe the relation between an object and its component objects; and **association structures**, which describe other meaningful object relations.

To describe the conceptual relations among classes, we apply two kidns of class structures: **generalization structures**, which describe a number of classes as specializations of a more general class; and **cluster structures**, which group collections of related classes.

We also deal with **abstract** classes and include them only for descriptive reasons. If a class name is using italics to signify their name its considered an abstraction that have no related objects.

**class structures** express static, conceptual relations between classes. The **object structures** on the other hand, express dynamic, concrete relations between objects.

## Structures between Classes

There are two types of class structures: **generalization** and **cluster**.

### Generalization Structure

A generalization structure us a relation between two or more specialization classes and a more general class

<Note>
  <strong>Generalization</strong>: A general class (the super class) describes
  properties common to a group of specialized classes (the subclasses).
</Note>

We call a specialized class a **subclass** and a generalized class a **super class**.

<Note>
  Specialization is expressed with the formulation <strong>"is-a"</strong>.
</Note>

A generalization structure is drawn as an arrow from the subclass to the super class. The class diagram is easier to understand if all arrow consistently point upwards, implying that generalization classes are above their specialization as specified in the below figure. In the figure the super class is `Passenger Car` and its subclasses are `Taxi` and `Private Car` resembling that for instance: `A Taxi is a Passenger Car`.

![Generalization](/images/structure-generalization.png)

The generalization structure expresses inheritance: Specialized classes inherit the properties and behavioural pattern of the general class. The typical generalization structure is hierarchical in that any subclass is a specialization of exactly one super class.

### Cluster Structure

A cluster is a collection of classes that helps us achieve and provide a problem-domain overview.

<Note>
  <strong>Cluster:</strong> A collection of related classes.
</Note>

The graphical notation is a file folder that encloses the classes as seen in the below figure:

![Cluster](/images/structure-cluster.png)

Classes within a cluster are usually connected by either a [generalization structure](#generalization-structure) or an [aggregation structure](#aggregation-structure). Additionally are relations between classes from different clusters usuaully [association structures](#association-structures).

## Structures between Objects

There are two types of object structures: **aggregation** and **association**. Both structures capture dynamic relations between objects.

### Aggregation Structure

An aggregation structure is a relation between two or more objects.

<Note>
  <strong>Aggregation:</strong> A superior object (the whole) consists of a
  number of inferior objects (the parts).
</Note>

An aggregation structure is drawn as a line between the classes of the whole and the parts, where the line is annotated with a rhomb at the class that models the whole. The below figure shows an example of an aggregation structure.

![Aggregation](/images/structure-aggregation.png)

In the above model the objects of `Cam Shaft` class can be part of an object of the `Engine` class, and an object of the `Car` class can aggregate an object of the `Engine` class.

The figure also illustrated the specification of **multiplicity**, which can be a single number or a range between two numbers.

<Note>
  Aggregation is expressed with the formulation <strong>"has-a"</strong>.
</Note>

### Association Structure

An association structure is also a relation between two or more objects, but it differs from aggregation in that associated objects are not a defining property of an object.

<Note>
  <strong>Association:</strong> A meaningful relation between a number of
  objects.
</Note>

An association structure is drawn as a simple line between the relevant classes. Association is often used when aggregation would imply a too strong relation.

<Note>
  Association is expressed with the formulation{" "}
  <strong>"associated-with"</strong> or <strong>"knows"</strong>.
</Note>

## Explore Patterns

A pattern is a generalized description of a problem and a related solution.

Here, we present four patterns that are concerned with structure.

### The Role Pattern

We use this person to model the situation in which a single person can have several different roles. The below figure illustrates a role pattern.

![The Role Pattern](/images/structure-role.png)

This structure lets a person change roles dynamically over time. The `Employee` and `Customer` is a generalization of the `Role` class, which aggregates from the `Person` class.

The special thing about the role pattern is that you can exclude and simplify the `Role` class if the generalized classes do not share common properties or behaviour.

### The Relation Pattern

The purpose of the structure pattern is to relate two parties to each other. An example of the structure pattern is illustrated below.

![Activities](/images/structure-relation.png)

Objects from both parties can have many relations, but each of them must be represented by exactly one relation object.

### The Hierachy Pattern

Many problem domains include objects that are organized into a hierachy with two or more level and relationships exist among objects on different levels.

![Activities](/images/structure-hierarchy.png)

### The Item-Descriptor Pattern

This pattern is utilised to establish distinction between items and their description. The below example is taken from a library. `Books` have descriptions and keywords to facilitate search, and numbers to determine where they are located in the library. Each `Copy` has its own identity and is treated as a separate entity, but all copies share the properties described by the related `book` object.

## Activities

![Activities](/images/structure-activities.png)

## Evaluate Systematically

The structures must be simple, especially at the top levels. It is seen as good practice to avoid unnescessary generalization and aggregations to keep it as clean and descriptive as possible. This is also the reason for why one should avoid objects changing class, since this require a total rework of the structure.

## Quiz

#### Question 3

> Generalization is a structure that expresses that:
>
> Select one or more:
>

> * Specialized classes inherit properties from a super class
> * We have a “consists-of” relation
> * We have an “is-a” relation

## Individual Exercises

#### Exercise 3 (page 89)

> Why is multiplicity only specified on object structures?

Multiplicity defines how many objects participate in a relationship and it is the
number of instances of one class related to one instance of another class.
For each association and aggregation, there are two multiplicity decisions
to make, one for each end of the relationship. Multiplicity is represented
as a number and a `*` is used to represent multiplicity of many.

This is why it is only specified on object structures since it defines
relationship between objects of classes.

#### Exercise 5 (page 89)

> What is the meaning of inheritance? How is it described?

Inheritance is a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different
classes. Inheritance allows a class to have the same behavior as another class and
extend or tailor that behavior to provide special action for specific needs.
