## Readings

Chapter 1 & 2.

## Summary of the OOA&D method
OOA&D covers the four perspectives through four main activities, shown in the below figure:

![OOA&D four activities](/images/introduction-ooad-activity.png)

### Purpose
* To determine system requirements.
* To produce a system design without significant uncertainties.
* To understand a system, its context, and the conditions for its implementations.

### Concepts
* Object: An entity with identity, state, and behavior.
* Class: A description of a collection of objects sharing structure, behavioral pattern, and attributes.
* Problem domain: That part of a context that is administrated, monitored, or controlled by a system.
* Application domain: The organization that administrates, monitors, or controls the problem domain.
* System: A collection of components that implements modeling requirements, functions, and interfaces.


### Principles
OOA&D builds on four general anlysis and design principles:

* _Model the context_. Useful systems fit their context. It is therefore essential to model both the application domain and the problem domain during analysis and design.
* _Emphasize the architecture_. An easy-to-understand architecture facilitates collaboration between designers and programmers. A flexible architecture makes system modification and improvements more affordable.
* _Reuse patterns_. Building on well-established ideas and pretested components improved system quality and development-process productivity.
* _Tailor the method to suit specific objects_. Each development effort has its own unique challenges. OOA&D must be tailored to the specific needs of a given analysis and design situation.

### Results
The tangible result of analysis and design is documentation, which helps you practically manage the actual analysis and design activities. Documentation helps create continuity during system development, and thus must be of high quality.


## Summary of system choice
The activity of system choice describes how to systematically examine project challenges and options, and how to obtain relevant and precise information as a basis for analysis and design.

![System choice activity](/images/introduction-system-choice-activity.png)

### Purpose
To agree on the overall system characteristics.

### Concept
System definition: A concice description of a computerized system expressed in natural language.

### Principles
* Appreciate the situation.
* Cultivate new ideas.
* Define alternative systems.

### Result
A system definition that fulfills the FACTOR criterion.


## System Definition
At the beginning of a development project, we must try to find interpretations that emphasize the important challenges. To do so, we can explicate and debate alternative system definitions:

<Note>
  <strong>System definition:</strong> A concise description of a computerized system expressed in natural language.
</Note>

A system definition expresses __fundamental properties for system development and use__. It describes the system in context, what information it should contain, which functions it should provide, where it is to be used, and which development conditions apply.

<Note>
  A system definition should be brief and precise, and contain the most fundamental decisions about the system.
</Note>

We will introduce the __FACTOR criterion__ for system definitions. Each of the six letters refers to a key element in system definition.

## Describe the Situation
Our understanding of the users' situation must be rich and abundant. By working with __rich pictures__ we can explicate important user views of a situation, facilite debate, and get an overview of the situation quickly. The main take away from this is to __obtain an overview__.

### Rich Pictures
<Note>
  A rich picture focuses on important aspects of the situation. Rich pictures should give a broad description of the situation that enables several alternative interpretations.
</Note>

A rich picture is an informal drawing that present the illustrator's understanding of a situation. The below figure shows an example of a rich picture:

![Rich picture](/images/introduction-rich-picture.png)

## The FACTOR Criterion
The FACTOR criterion consists of six elements:

* __Functionality__: The system functions that support the application-domain tasks.
* __Application domain__: Those parts of an organization that administrate, monitor, or control a problem domain.
* __Conditions__: The conditions under which the system will be developed and used.
* __Technology__: Both the technology used to develop the system and the technology on which the system will run.
* __Objects__: The main objects in the problem domain.
* __Responsibility__: The system's overall responsibility in relation to its context.

An example of a FACTOR criteria is listed below:

* __Functionality:__ A system that allows an employee of Dania Academy to place an order of
specific food products and quantities. They should be able to choose when and where the
order should be delivered, as well as a purpose, project number and a person responsible
for approving the funds needed (budgeteers). Once an order has been placed, the system
should ensure that the kitchen personnel receives it and is able to confirm or reject
it. The kitchen should be able to gather a quick overview of orders and filter them based
on delivery time. They should also be able to print orders, allowing for easier handling in
and around the kitchen. Once an order has been completed by the kitchen, the person
responsible for approving funds should be able to do so within the system, at which point
the order should be forwarded to a bookkeeper. The bookkeeper should be able to export
all necessary information about orders to a spreadsheet.
* __Application Domain:__ The system will be used by the chef, budgeteers, bookkeepers and
employees acting as customers purchasing catering.
* __Conditions:__ The system will be developed for multiple types of users situated at Dania
Academy. These users involve the chef, budgeteers, bookkeepers, and the employees at
Dania Academy who acts as customers when ordering catering from the chef. The setting
for the chef using the system will be in the canteen whereas the other above-mentioned
people will be in an office. The chef and employees are assumed to have largely varying
experience with IT systems. The system should thus be intuitive and user-friendly for the
varying types of users. The development will be in close cooperation withDania Academy
to ensure that the system suits their workflow and needs.
* __Technology:__ The system will run on the Windows Platform with connection to a MySQL
Server. The solution will be developed using C#.
* __Objects:__ Administrator, chef, budgeteer, bookkeeper, booker, order, and food type.
* __Responsibility:__ The systems primary responsibility is to handle all orders of catering
within the organisation and make sure that they are sent between the relevant people.
The system should also deliver a structured visualisation of the ordered catering, making
it easier for the users to bookkeep and manage the orders.

## Individual Exercises

#### Exercise 1 (page 19)

> What is the difference between objects and classes?

An **Object** is an entity with identity, state, and behaviour.
A **Class** is a description of a collection of objects sharing structure,
behavioural pattern, and attributes.

In _analysis_ an object is an abstraction of a phenomenon in the system's context,
such as a customer. A specific customer is treated as a single entity with an
identity, state, and behaviour. Opposed to objects acting as a single entity will classes act as a container for multiple objects. Instead of describing each particular
object, the class functions as a shared object description for all objects in the same
class.

#### Exercise 4 (page 19)

> Why should systems developers understand the context of the systems they are designing?

A key task in analysis and design is to model what the system will administrate,
monitor, or control. System developers should analyze the problem domain, both to understand the system's context and to learn how to usefully representing it to the system's users. A second key task in analysis and design is to model how the system will interact with users in the application domain. This includes identifying all user groups and understanding both what they will use the system for and how each group will interact with the system in different situations. However, users and system developers interpret things in different ways thus system development requires a common understanding between the developer and user. OOA&D focuses on this challenge.

#### Exercise 5 (page 19)

> How can you distinguish between a system's problem domain and application domain?
> Can they partly overlap?

The system's context can be viewed from two complementary perspectives: the system models something (the problem domain) and it is operated by users (the application domain). We define them as following:

- **Problem domain:** _That part of a context that is administrated, monitored or controlled by a system_.
- **Application domain:** _The organization that administrates, monitors, or controls a problem domain_.

To establish a clear separation between the two you could think of it as being: The problem domain is part of the real world and consists of entities that exists in the real world. The application domain consists of software entities in the implementation of the solution. However, they need to be tighly connected to fully resemble the problem domain.

#### Exercise 2 (page 43)

> What is a system definition and how is it used?

A **system definition** is a concise description of a computerized system expressed in a natural language. It seeks to describe the system in context, what information it should contain, which functions it should provide, where it is to be used, and which development conditions apply. Furthermore, it should be brief and precise, and contain the most fundamental decisions about the system.

The system definition is produced by iterating through the three subactivities:

1. **Situation:** Focuses on challenges.
2. **Ideas:** Create and evaluate ideas.
3. **Systems:** Formulate and choose system definition.

To describe the situation in the first subactibity one could apply the usage of **Rich Pictures**, which focuses on important aspects of a given situation. This enables participants to get ideas and bring creativity into the project.

The result of the second subactivity is a collection of ideas, but in order to establish and evaluate ideas in operation with the users, one could make use of _exemplars_, _metaphors_, and _experiments_. The most important are probably exemplars in the form existing solutions, and experiments in the form of prototypes.

The purpose of the third and final subactivity is to choose the actual system to develop. After thoroughly creating and evaluating new ideas based on Rich Pictures, exemplars, or prototypes, it is time to decide on an actual system definition. The definition describes a totality, or a whole. It will therefore express emergent, system-focus properties, rather than detailed, component-oriented properties.

#### Exercise 9 (page 43)

> What are the elements in the FACTOR criterion for system definition?

The **FACTOR criterion** consists of six elements:

- **Functionality:** The system functions that support the application-domain tasks.
- **Application domain:** Those parts of an organization that administrate, monitor, or control a problem domain.
- **Conditions:** The conditions under which the system will be developed and used.
- **Technology:** Both the technology used to develop the system and the technology on which the system till run.
- **Objects:** The main objects in the problem domain.
- **Responsibility:** The system's overall responsibility in relation to its context.

The FACTOR criterion can be used in two ways:

1. Use it to support system-definition development.
2. Start the definition by describing the system and then use the criterai to see how the system definition satisfies each of the six factors.
