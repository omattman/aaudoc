## Summary of connection of components
In other design activities, we model the relationships between components and dependencies. These dependencies can be realized in different ways. In this activity, we design the connections between components to obtain flexible and comprehensible designs.

The connecting components activity can be summarized in a single principle:

<Note>
  <i>Highly cohesive classes and loosely couples components.</i> You must make trade-offs to achieve classes and components that are both cohesive and have low coupling between them. The observer pattern is an example of how to implement this principle.
</Note>

### Purpose
To connect system components.

### Concepts

Highly cohesive classes and loosely coupled components.

### Principles

* Coupling: A measure of how closely two classes or components are connected.
* Cohesion: A measure of how well a class or component is tied together.

### Results
A class diagram of the involved components.

## Coupling and Cohesion
__Coupling__ and __cohesion__ are structural measures that we assess by evaluating the class diagrams of the involved components. We summarize the two measures as following:

<Note>
  Highly cohesive classes and loosely couples components. This means that the ideal for complex system is therefore that they are nearly decomposable.
</Note>

A __nearly decomposable system__ is a system in which there is so little couples between its parts thats a slight decrease in coupling would make it nonexisting.

### Coupling
Coupling expresses that change in one class or components necessitates change in another class or component, and we describe it as:

<Note>
  <strong>Coupling:</strong> A measure of how closely two classes or components are connected.
</Note>

__Coupling is a negative property__, and you should seek to minimize it it as much as possible. Coupling can take one of the following __four forms__.

* __Outside coupling__: A class or component refers directly to the public properties of another class or component.
* __Inside coupling__: An operation refers directly to other, private properties in the same class.
* __Coupling from below__: A specialized class refers directly to private properties in the super class.
* __Sideways coupling__: A class refers directly to private properties in another class.

<Note>
  You can generally obtain low coupling by using outside coupling and avoiding sideways coupling.
</Note>

### Cohesion
Cohesion expresses that a class or component constitutes a whole with essential relations between its parts, and we describe it as:

<Note>
  <strong>Cohesion:</strong> A measure of how well a class or component is tied together.
</Note>

Attempts to split up cohesive classes or components __lead to a high degree of coupling__. Coupling is thus a __positive property__ that you should pursue in your design of classes and components.

Several properties points to high cohesion when we look at classes and objects:

* Operations constitute a functional whole
* Attributes and object structures describe objects with well-defined states.
* Operations use each other.

Component cohesion has similar significance. The following features point to cohesive components:

* Component classes are conceptually related.
* Structural relations among classes are primarily generalizations and aggregations.
* Key operations can be carried out within the component.

<Note>
  When classes and components are cohesive, you can easily find a precise and appropriate name for them.
</Note>

Cohesion leads to __greater comprehensibility__.

### Connecting components
To connect components, you should design connections among dependent components and classes so that they maintain their cohesiveness, but at the same time __ensure that these connections are as loosely coupled__ as possible.

## Connect Classes
The relationship among components are generally described as __dependencies__. These dependencies must be realized as connections between the classes and objects in the components. There are three forms of connection:

* Aggregating another component's classes.
* Specializing another component's public class.
* Calling public operations in another component's objects.

<Note>
  The call connection is often preferred as it makes it easier to achieve cohesion and low coupling.
</Note>

### Class Aggregation
You can aggregate another component's public class. That is, in the class definition, you can use other class definitions to form an aggregate structure. An example of this is shown below:

![Connection: Aggregation](images/connection-of-components-aggregation.png)

The dependency is realized by letting a class in one component aggregate a public class from another component.

The connection is useful when a class definition already exists in another component. __Coupling is generally low, as it is coupled from outside__. Aggregating various classes from different components into a class generally makes cohesion difficult to achieve.

### Class Specialization
You can use a public class from another component to define a new class by specialization. That is, in the definition of a class, you can use other class definitions to form a specialization structure. __All the properties in the super class will then be inherited by the subclass__. An example of such specialization is seen below:

![Connection: Specialization](images/connection-of-components-specialization.png)

<Note>
  The specialization connection is useful when you use classes provided by other classes. The advantage is that you do not have to tamper with the provided class, rather you can simply add properties by specializing.
</Note>

Coupling is somewhere between __coupling from outside and coupling from below__.

### Operation Call
You can also realize dependency between two components by having an __operation in one component's object call an operation in another component's object__. An example of such operation call is seen below:

![Connection: Call](images/connection-of-components-call.png)

The above figure shows how one component calls a public operation in another component.

Connecting classes by __calling an operation is generally considered low coupling__. The calling operation can only use the publicly available operations in the other component.


## Explore Patterns

The most general pattern for realizing dependencies between classes is called __Observer__.

- The __Subject__ knows its observers and provides attaching and detaching observers.
- The Observer provides an update operation to the subject.
- The involved objects are all from either __Concrete Subject__ or __Concrete Observer__.
- The concrete subject notifies its observers when its state has changed.
- The concrete observers each know their concrete subject and each implement the update operation.

<Note>
  You can use the observer pattern when several objects depend on one object's change of state. When the state changes, the dependent objects are notified and updated automatically.
</Note>

The below figure illustrates the class structure of the observer pattern:

![Observer pattern structure](/images/connection-of-components-observer-pattern-structure.png)

The observer pattern is __useful in separating who knows what about whom__. In particular it is useful for maintaining a strictly layered component architecture. The below figure illustrates how we can apply and use the observer pattern:

![Observer Pattern](images/connection-of-components-observer-pattern.png)

In this example the `Account` is the concrete object, and the `Signal` class contains the operations to observe the state of an `Account` object.

## Evaluate Connections
You should evaluate connections during a review of the detailed component design. The below figure illustrates the __three forms of connection and how they generally relate to the measures__.

## Individual Exercises

#### Exercise 1 (page 283)

> What is coupling?

Coupling expresses that change in one class or components necessitates change in another class or component. Furthermore, it is a measure of how closely two classes or components are connected.

#### Exercise 2 (page 283)

> What is cohesion?

Cohesion expresses that a class or component constitutes a whole with essential relations between its parts. Furthermore, it is a measure of how well a class or component is tied together.

#### Exercise 3 (page 283)

> Why should we design cohesive classes and components with low coupling?

If we design cohesive classes and components with low coupling we obtain a nearly decomposable system. This makes the system highly flexible and thus easy to swap out parts as the classes are cohesive with little to no coupling between its components.

#### Exercise 7 (page 283)

> How are connections between components evaluated?

The connection between components are evaluated during a review of the detailed component design in relation to its three forms of connections, which can be seen in the section regarding [evaluation of the connections](#evaluate-connections).
