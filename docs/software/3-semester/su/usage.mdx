This lecture presents the fourth activity in Object-Oriented Analysis, more precisely you will get:

1. An overview of the whole analysis of the application domain
2. A detailed presentation of the usage activity
3. A discussion of the different means for describing actors and use cases

## Readings

Chapter 6 and 19 (pages 362 - 364)

## Summary of usage

To be usable, a system must fit the application domain. On the following sections we look at how we can determine this fit. We do this by describing actors and use cases based on an understanding of application-domain activities. The use cases provide an overview of the system requirements from the users' perspective and provide a foundation for defining and evaluating the more basic function and interface requirements.

### Purpose

To determine how actors interact with a system.

### Concepts

- Actor: An abstraction of users or other systems
  that interact with the target system.
- Use case: A pattern for interaction between the system
  and actors in the application domain.

### Principles

- Determine the application domain with use cases.
- Evaluate use cases in collaboration with users.
- Assess social changes in the application domain.

### Results

Descriptions of all use cases and actors.

## Use Cases

Use cases can help you achieve a relevant focus and abstraction level. In this activity they key concepts are:

<Note>
  <strong>Actors:</strong> An abstraction of users or other system that interact
  with the system.
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Use case:</strong> A pattern for interaction between the system and actors
  in the application domain.
</Note>

Actors are an abstraction of people and other system that activate a target system's functions.

A use case is an abstraction of an interaction with the target system. It can be initiated by an actor or by the target system. Furthermore, the complete set of use cases determine all uses of the target system within the application domain. They originate from needs and conditions in the application domain, but a use case is itself an expression of a solution.

It is possible to illustrate the relation between actors and use cases using either an **actor table** or a **use-case diagram**. We prefer the actor table, as it consumes less space. An example of the table is seen below, where left column described the use cases and the top row describes actors involved:

|                     | Account owner | Creditor | Administrator | Liquidity monitor |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Payment             | ✔             | ✔        |               |                   |
| Cash withdrawal     | ✔             |          |               |                   |
| Money transfer      | ✔             | ✔        | ✔             |                   |
| Account information | ✔             |          | ✔             | ✔                 |
| Credit information  |               | ✔        | ✔             |                   |
| Registration        |               |          | ✔             |                   |
| Monitoring          |               |          | ✔             |                   |
| Error correction    |               |          | ✔             |                   |

### Actors and Classes, Use Cases, and Events

An actor table looks similar to the previously discussed event table in the [class activity](/software/3-semester/su/classes/#event-table). This raises the question: **Is there any difference between actors with use cases and classes with events?** The answer is yes. The main difference is that the phenomena occur in different domains.

A **class describes** something that the target system should manage, such as a customer. An **actor describes** someone or something that interacts physically with the system, such as a clerk (ekspedient). An **event describes** an incident the system must be aware of, such as when a customer orders certain goods. A **use case describes** the interaction between an actor and the system, such as a clerk entering an order.

<Note>
  Actors and classes describe static aspects, while use cases and events
  describe dynamic aspects.
</Note>

## Find Actors and Use Cases

The central questions about the target system's usage are: **Who will use the system? How will it be used?** You can answer these questions in terms of actors and use cases.

### Identify Actors

To identify actors, you must determine the division of labor and the task-related roles in the target system's context. It is important to figure out the different areas of works tasks to specifically be a able to tie a unique actor to the correct works tasks.

The criterion for determining different actors is the dissimilarity of roles, as expressed by the use cases in which actors are involved.

<Note>
  If several roles appear the same to the system, you should consider solidating
  them into one actor.
</Note>

### Describe Actors

An **actor specification** consists of three parts: _goal, characteristics, and examples_. The goal describes, as precisely as possible, the actor's role in relation to the target system. The characteristics describe important aspects of actors' use of the system. Below is an example of an actor specification shown:

![Actor specifications for "Account Owner"](/images/usage-actor-example.png)

### Describe Use Cases

The use cases are abstractions of the interactions between the system and the actors. It is vital that you choose suitable abstractions as we delimit a use case based on the specific actors' viewpoint and application-domain tasks.

<Note>
  <strong>Goal:</strong> Collect the many possible ways of using the target
  system in a few well-chosen use cases.
</Note>

Because use cases are dynamic phenomena, you can describe this by using **statechart diagrams** or **text specifications**. An example of a statechart diagram is seen below:

![Statechart Diagram](/images/usage-statechart-diagram.png)

A statechart diagram defines the different states of the interaction and the different ways the system or actor can change that state. However, in a use-case specification, the use case itself is precisely described in a structured text that focuses on the actors. **Statechart diagrams are the preferred method** as these provide a good overview of the dynamic process and the logic of a use case, but omits many details. Even thought it omits details it is still preferred over use-case specifications as these make it difficult to describe its logic.

### Use Case and Actor Structures

Actors can also be related to each other, as can use cases, which can overlap or use each other.

Just as we organise the problem domain by describing abstract structures between the classes and relating the classes by common events, we **organise the application domain by structuring actors and use cases**.

Use-case diagrams can show **use-case groupings**, which function much like clusters for structuring.

## Differences between Actors and Classes

|         | Application domain | Problem domain        |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Static  | Actors             | Classes and structure |
| Dynamic | Use cases          | Behavioral patterns   |

## Explore Patterns

Patterns are a source of inspiration that can help you identify and describe use cases.

### The Procedural Pattern

The **procedural use-case pattern** is the general solution to ensuring that **many rules are observed**. The pattern's basic structure is **a sequence** with minor variations in terms of selections or iterations.

![The Procedural Pattern](/images/usage-procedural-pattern.png)

### The Material Pattern

The **material pattern** is good for situations in which there are **no business rules governing the usage**. We call this the "material" use case as it resembles an artisan's material process: Any tool may be used in any order:

![The Material Pattern](/images/usage-material-pattern.png)

## Evaluate Systematically

There are three ways to evaluate use cases:

1. Carefully review the descriptions to find mistakes and inconsistencies.
2. Test your use cases to see if they work in practice.
3. Evaluate the social changes in the application.

### Systematic review

- Use cases should be simple and constitute a coherent whole.
- The description of actors and uses cases should provide understanding and overview.
- Use cases should be described in enough detail to enable identification of functions and interface elements.

## Individual Exercises

#### Exercise 2 (page 149)

> What is a use case?

A use case is a pattern for interaction between the system and actors in the application domain.

#### Exercise 3 (page 149)

> What are actor tables used for?

Actor tables illustrates the relation between actors and use cases to determine how actors interact with a system. An example of this is seen in [use cases](#use-cases).

#### Exercise 5 (page 149)

> How are actors described?

An actor is described through its specification, which includes three parts:

1. Goal
2. Characteristics
3. Examples

The goal describes, as precisely as possible, the actor’s role in relation to the target system. The characteristics describe important aspects of actors’ use of the system.

#### Exercise 7 (page 149)

> What are the key features of the procedural pattern?

It ensures that many business rules are observed. This is required for some uses, and this should be applied if that is the case. The use case must follow a strict procedure as described in [the procedural pattern](#the-procedural-pattern).
